[h1]Features[/h1]
This mod adds a container where you can register your favorite apparels.

By assigned a colonist as the owner of the container, the colonist can change into all their favorite apparels with one click.
On the contrary, you can take it off with one click.

The recommended way to use it is to register combat apparels in your favorites.
By doing so, you can easily change between normal and combat apparels.
Colonists can usually spend time in work apparels, and when colonists are attacked, colonists can wear combat apparels and intercept them.



[h1]Details[/h1]
Add the following two containers.

■Fav Locker
You can register any apparels.
When changing into a favorite, colonists change apparels faster than usual.

■Power Armor Station
It is like a power armor station that appeared in fallout 4, and you can only register power armor that can be produced in the final stage.
The time to change apparels is significantly reduced.
